            <h2>The Penne Dreadful Murder</h2>
            <p>
                4-week proof-of-concept of a point-and-click murder mystery game. Working in a group, I contributed
                project management, level design, and UI design, including asset illustration and text-box object
                scripting in C#. Unity's Text Mesh Pro UI package was also utilized.
            </p>
            <p>
                My aesthetic direction for this project was inspired by our team's main artist, whose style is
                reminiscent of doodles in a notebook. I wanted to stay true to her style for our project, which happened
                to align well with my own drawing style. I also wanted to keep true to this style by choosing
                handwriting fonts.
