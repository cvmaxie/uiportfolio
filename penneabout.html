            <h2>The Penne Dreadful Murder</h2>
            <p>
                4-week proof-of-concept of a point-and-click murder mystery game. Working in a group, I contributed project management, level design, and UI design, including asset illustration and text-box object scripting in C#. Unity's Text Mesh Pro UI package was
                also utilized.
            </p>
            <p>
                My aesthetic direction for this project was inspired by our team's main artist, whose style is reminiscent of doodles in a notebook. I wanted to stay true to her style for our project, which happened to align well with my own drawing style. I also wanted
                to keep true to this style by choosing handwriting fonts.
